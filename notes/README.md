# Software Development Life Cycle

***Software development life cycle (SDLC)*** is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process. SDLC is a structure followed by a development team within the software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain and replace specific software.

The software industry includes many different processes. For example analysis, development, maintenance and publication of software also some times includes software services, such as training, documentation, and consulting. So, due to that different types of projects have different requirements. Therefore, it may be required to choose the SDLC phases according to the specific needs of the project. These different requirements and needs give us various software development approaches to choose from during software implementation.

Software life cycle models describe phases of the software cycle and the order in which those phases are executed. Each phase produces deliverables required by the next phase in the life cycle. Requirements are translated into design. Code is produced according to the design which is called development phase. After coding and development the testing verifies the deliverable of the implementation phase against requirements.

Various SDLC methodologies have been developed to guide the processes involved, including the waterfall model (which was the original SDLC method); rapid application development (RAD); joint application development (JAD); the fountain model; the spiral model; build and fix; and synchronize-and-stabilize. Frequently, several models are combined into some sort of hybrid methodology. Documentation is crucial regardless of the type of model chosen or devised for any application, and is usually done in parallel with the development process. Some methods work better for specific types of projects, but in the final analysis, the most important factor for the success of a project may be how closely the particular plan was followed.

There are following six phases in every Software development life cycle model:

1. Requirement gathering and analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation or coding
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

***1. Requirement gathering and analysis***

This phase is critical to the success of the project. Expectations either of a client or your team need to be fleshed out in great detail and documented.  This is an iterative process with much communication taking place between stakeholders, end users and the project team.  The following techniques can be used to gather requirements

* Identify and capture stakeholder requirements using customer interviews and surveys.
* Build multiple use cases to describe each action that a user will take in the new system.
* Prototypes can be built to show the client what the end product will look like.

__*2. Design*__

Technical design requirements are prepared in this phase by lead development staff that can include architects and lead developers.  The Business Requirements are used to define how the application will be written.  Technical requirements will detail database tables to be added, new transactions to be defined, security processes and hardware and system requirements.
